# Richardson, TX Weather Analysis (2020â€“2024)

This project explores climate trends in Richardson, Texas, using historical temperature data from the past five years (2020â€“2024). It focuses on how average monthly temperatures and extreme heat days have changed over time â€” a growing concern in many U.S. cities, including suburban areas like Richardson.

##  Project Goals

- Investigate local climate changes over the past 5 years
- Visualize monthly and seasonal temperature patterns
- Identify long-term warming trends and extreme heat events (e.g., days over 90Â°F)
- Practice real-world data cleaning, time series grouping, and effective storytelling with data

## ðŸ““ Notebook Summaries

### 1. `1_EDA.ipynb` â€“ Initial Exploration
- Cleaned and processed raw data (TMAX, TMIN)
- Computed daily average temperatures (`TAVG`)
- Added datetime features like year, month, and day
- Checked for missing values and outliers

### 2. `2_Monthly_Seasonal_Trends.ipynb` â€“ Trends Over Time
- Created monthly and seasonal average temperature plots
- Built a heatmap showing temperature patterns per year/month
- Counted number of days > 90Â°F by year (extreme heat events)

### 3. `3_Insights_Report.ipynb` â€“ Key Insights & Visual Storytelling
- Highlighted clear temperature increases between 2020 and 2024
- Noted spikes in extreme heat days, especially in 2023â€“2024
- Wrapped up findings with clean visualizations and takeaways

## Key Findings

- **Warming Trend**: Monthly averages are increasing, especially during summer.
- **Hot Days Rising**: Number of days over 90Â°F jumped sharply in 2023 and 2024.
- **Seasonal Shift**: Spring and fall are becoming warmer, reducing comfort months.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Excel (data source)
- VS Code

## Why This Project?

I built this project as a practical exercise in data science â€” not machine learning â€” to strengthen my skills in:
- Real-world data wrangling
- Visual storytelling
- Finding patterns and trends in climate time series
- Working independently on a self-guided question
